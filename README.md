# sberbank_ml
At the end of the data science courses from Sberbank, I completed this graduation project. After that, I implemented it in the company where I work.
In this project, I predict the price of electricity in Russia based on the generation of power plants, ambient temperature, current flow between regions.

# Details
The repository has a presentation. Please read it to better understand the problem and the principle of its solution.

We load data from google drive, process, analyze, make visualizations.

We make a forecast using catboost, a neural network and compare the metrics with the result of linear regression, which was used earlier in the company.
